Dota Counter Picker
===================
Introduction
-------------------
This program is designed to aid Dota 2 players during the drafting process. Using massive sample sizes from stat website [Dotabuff][1], we can evaluate general effectiveness of specific heroes against a given enemy team. To run the counter picker, run main.py to launch the GUI.

Installing
-------------------
Dota Counter Picker requires [pyQt4][2], and all associated libraries. Follow the pyQt4 installation guide. Everything else should work without additional installations. For full functionality, make sure HeroList.txt is up to date. If you make a change to the HeroList, delete data.csv and update the data by clicking File>Update Data (should take about 2 minutes to update depending on internet speeds).
