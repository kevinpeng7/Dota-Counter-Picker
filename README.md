Dota Counter Picker
===================
Introduction
-------------------
This program is designed to aid Dota 2 players during the drafting process. Using massive sample sizes from stat website [Dotabuff][1], we can evaluate general effectiveness of specific heroes against a given enemy team. To run the counter picker, run main.py to launch the GUI.

Installing
-------------------
Dota Counter Picker requires [pyQt4][2], and all associated libraries. Follow the pyQt4 installation guide. Everything else should work without additional installations. For full functionality, make sure HeroList.txt is up to date. And for best results, consider updating data by clicking File>Update Data (should take about 2 minutes to update depending on internet speeds).
